# Elden Tree

In the land of ancient gods, the Elden Tree is known as the center base; It is responsible for being
a safe place for each god’s events, and it will carefully transform the events between corresponding
lands. But, unfortunately, the previous demi-god programmer who developed the Elden Tree’s
event handler, was a junior and used Js as the base language and it makes the gods angry about
the delays between receiving each event. So, please rewrite and redesign the Elden Tree’s event
handler in C++ ”to be fast”.

## Considerations
1. You should use the standard C++ as the base language.
2. Provide the Elden Tree’s event handler as a separate library.
3. You can use templated classes or custom and flexible data models.
4. There is no limit on how fast it can be, but it is a plus if you provide benchmarks.
5. Also, be careful about the gods who have a lot of events; your event handler should not forget
about other gods.
